A: Hey, how have you been feeling lately? You seem a bit off.

B: Yeah, I've been dealing with some health issues recently. I've been experiencing these persistent headaches that just won't go away.

A: Oh no, that sounds awful. Have you seen a doctor about it?

B: Yeah, I went last week. They did some tests and it turns out I have migraines. They prescribed me some medication, but it's been a bit of a trial finding the right dosage that works for me.

A: Migraines can be really tough to deal with. Have you noticed any triggers that might be causing them?

B: I think stress might be a big factor. Work has been really hectic lately, and I've been feeling more anxious than usual.

A: It's good that you're aware of that. Maybe finding some ways to relax and de-stress could help alleviate the headaches.

B: Yeah, I've been trying to incorporate more mindfulness and relaxation techniques into my daily routine. Hopefully, that will make a difference.

A: Definitely. And remember, if the headaches persist or get worse, it might be worth checking back in with your doctor to explore other treatment options.

B: Thanks for the support. It means a lot to me. It's been tough dealing with this, but having friends like you to talk to really helps.
